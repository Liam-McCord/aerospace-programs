# OrbiTool-trajectory-optimizer
This is my attempt at building a python trajectory optimizer in an n-body environment. 
Hopefully when done, the program should be able to state the optimal velocities in multiple directions in 3D space to get an object to a target point. This will link with my other n-body-simulation project. Essentially this should allow you to optimize optimal paths for orbits, though I'm unsure what the accuracy will be.
